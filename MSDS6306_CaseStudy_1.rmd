#Keeping An's code for UniqueBeers but adding Jodi's as UniqueBeer2 in case An's version is correct. The code below keeps everything is not a duplicate in Name, ABV, IBU, Brewery_ID, Style and Ounces.
#Jodi's is correct, there were some beers that were incorrectly removed with my code.  ANguyen 6/15/2018
