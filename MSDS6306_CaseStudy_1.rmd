####Tidying Breweries Data
```{r}
#Tidying Breweries.csv Section. Completed by Rajat and Andy
#First inspect the State column.  We listed out the States and got the count for each.  If observation > 50, we investigated further by examining all the States with a count of 1 (DC, ND, SD, WV).  In this case, there was 51 States and confirmed the 51st was DC which is acceptable.  All abbreviations in State column is valid.
breweries <- read.csv("Breweries.csv", header = TRUE)
str(breweries)
summary(breweries)
table(breweries$State)
```

```{r}
#In this section, looking to clean up the "City" column.  Still looking for a more elequent code but for now creating subsets for each letter and visually identifying misspellings, abbreviations, and/or punctuations.  Rajat to research a function that creates a subset of cities by subsetting cities with the same 3 letter string.
unique(breweries[grep("[.]", breweries$City), "City"])
unique(breweries[grep("^[Mm].*", breweries$City), "City"])
unique(breweries[grep("^[Ss].*", breweries$City), "City"])
```

```{r}
#With State and City cleaned up, we check for duplicates breweries by matching the name, each's city, than state.  Still in process.
